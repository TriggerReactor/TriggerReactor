# General Guideline
* Indents are four-spaces
* I highly recommend to follow the [Code Convention](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconvtoc-136057.html)

# Contribution
## Wiki
Everybody has different perspective, and it's hard for me to fill everything up while working on the code. More importantly,
writing down information doesn't necessarily will help people who read it. So if you know how to use TriggerReactor and want to make
Wiki even better, please don't wait for my permission. The Wiki section is open to public, and all you need to do is pressing edit button.

* Please use appropriate language (no slang, etc)
    * But of course, I don't care about what you put in the example. For example, `#MESSAGE "hue hue"`
* Only use information that is based on facts.

## Executor/Placeholder (Javascript)
If you have created plugin yourself, and you think you want to contribute, Executors and Placeholders are good place. They are written
in Javascript.

To contribute, fork TriggerReactor and add/modify/remove Executors and Placeholders under 
[src/main/resources](https://github.com/wysohn/TriggerReactor/tree/master/src/main/resources). Once you are done, make pull request,
then I will add it to the main branch.

* You must test your code before making pull request. Testing Executor and Placeholder are easy as you can just paste your js file into
the appropriate folder, and use /trg reload command to load it without restarting the server.
* If tests are done, you must explain about your work to people.
    * If you created a new Executor/Placeholder, update the Wiki, so people will be able to know how to use what you've made
    * If you modified an Executor/Placeholder, make sure to update the Wiki as necessary.

## Core code
If you know Java very well and are experienced plugin developer (and knowing data structure or algorithms is plus), you may contribute bug fixes, add new features, etc. to the actual
TriggerReactor source code. Once you are done, make a pull request.

* Please test your code yourself.
* Please update Wiki as necessary. 

## FINALLY
Even if you think your contribution is small compared to others, it's still a contribution, so please don't hesitate to add your name to plugin.yml. You are **highly encouraged** by me to do so. I usually add them myself too, but you are always welcome to be part of it if you have done anything to contribute to make TR even better.
